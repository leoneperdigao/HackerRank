# Document Collaborator

## Problem Description
The Sales team for the ACME company wants to have a centralized board 
where all the sales professionals can share their progress with their 
clients and make this information visible to their colleagues. Because 
of the nature of their job, they cannot be at the office everyday and 
this complicates communication with their colleagues. The manager 
suggested a virtual white board where the professionals can access and
update their 'cards' on real time and make this visible to all.

As part of an internal project for the Sales team, you are in charge of 
building a proof of concept (to keep it simple and to present the idea 
to the manager) with just the implementation of how the professionals 
can join the whiteboard and how the information will be visible for 
everyone 'connected' in real time.

### Prototype Design
In order to reduce the scope of the prototype and just proof the live 
collaboration functionality, below is the description of the expected
functionality.

- There will be a "whiteboard" where we can add posts
- The "whiteboard" updates all "sales professionals" notes
- The "sales professionals" will be able to add "posts" with a note and a X/Y position
- A "sales professional" can add, remove or move a note in the "whiteboard" 

### Given Resources
On the source code, the following is provided:

- Whiteboard.java
- Professional.java
- ProfessionalImpl.java
- BoardManager.java
- BoardManagerImpl.java
- Post.java

### Expected
With the given resources, it is expected for you to complete the 
implementation by using the Mediator pattern as part of this solution.
